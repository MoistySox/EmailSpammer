Want to get back at a really annoying kid? This is the way how. Spam their email as many times as you want.

ONLY WORKS WITH GMAIL

I don't recommend using your main email for this.

In order for this to work, 2FA needs to be turned off ( at https://myaccount.google.com/signinoptions/two-step-verification), and you need to turn off less secure app access ( at https://myaccount.google.com/u/3/lesssecureapps ).
